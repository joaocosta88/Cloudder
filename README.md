This repo contains the code of the Cloudder Android application.

This application is synchronized (download and upload) files between different cloud storage providers. Google Drive, Box and Dropbox were integrated in this app.

This application is no longer available in the android app store but the code is available for anyone to use it. Maybe one day I'll update it to current standards.


Some screenshots of the application:
